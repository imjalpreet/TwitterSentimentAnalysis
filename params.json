  "body": "# Twitter Sentiment Analysis\r\n***\r\n## Problem Statement\r\n\r\nThe aim of this project is to classify tweets based on their polarity mainly into three categories positive, negative or neutral.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Sentiment Analysis\r\n\r\n* Sentiment analysis (also known as opinion mining) refers to the use of natural language processing, text analysis and computational linguistics to identify and extract subjective information in source materials.\r\n* Consumers can use sentiment analysis to research products and services before a purchase. Production companies can use the public opinion to determine acceptance of their products and the public demand. Movie-goers can decide whether to watch a movie or not after going through other peopleâ€™s reviews.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Goal\r\n\r\n* Input: It will be a tweet in textual format downloaded from the twitter API.\r\n* Output: It should be the label that specifies the polarity (positive, negative, neutral) of the given tweet.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Challenges\r\n\r\n* Usernames are mentioned more often than not. Usually they consist of some alphabets and numbers, and do not contribute much towards sentiment classification, except for increasing the size of the feature vector.\r\n* URLs too are not required in our task.\r\n* Repeated letters People often repeat letters in some words, in order to stress upon a particular emotion. For example:- sad, saaaad, saaaddd. All of them mean the same, yet it is not possible to distinguish between them if guided only by their spellings. \r\n* Hashtags Words in hashtags may be read different from the same word without the hash tag.\r\n* Punctuation and additional spaces.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Approach/Flow\r\n\r\n![Flow](https://s28.postimg.org/z0jybjwyl/flow.png)",
